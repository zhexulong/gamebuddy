/**
 * Compartment events storage (v2 / E2).
 *
 * The historian extracts discrete events (`causal_incident`,
 * `trajectory_correction`, and any future kinds) while compartmentalizing. v2.0
 * STORES these events but does NOT render them — they are a corpus for a future
 * dreamer aggregation/steering feature (cross-session pattern detection). Parsed
 * kind-agnostically (`kind` = element name, `fields` = child elements), so a new
 * event kind or field needs no schema change — `fields` round-trips as JSON.
 *
 * Anchoring: `at_compartment="N"` is a 1-based index INTO THE CURRENT PUBLISH's
 * emitted compartment list. We resolve it to the `compartment_id` of the matching
 * persisted row at store time. When resolution fails (out-of-range index, e.g. an
 * event anchored to a discard-last compartment), `compartment_id` is NULL and we
 * keep the raw `at_compartment` for debugging.
 *
 * Durability caveat: `compartment_id` is a bare INTEGER (no FK). It points at the
 * compartment row that existed at store time. Full/partial recomp deletes and
 * re-inserts compartment rows, so a stored `compartment_id` can become stale
 * (dangling) after recomp. This is acceptable for v2.0 because events are
 * STORED-ONLY (not rendered or consumed yet); the future dreamer aggregation
 * feature that reads events must re-anchor or tolerate dangling ids. Do NOT rely
 * on `compartment_id` surviving recomp.
