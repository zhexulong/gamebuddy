/**
 * compress-cues prompt + manifest parser (non-agentic single-shot transform).

 * room grouping, ranking, AND cue compression in one LLM call — three of those
 * four jobs are deterministic and were being re-done (badly) by the model every
 * week. This task keeps ONLY the genuinely-generative job: compress one memory's
 * content into a terse pidgin cue. Selection (overflow complement) and packing
 * (rank-ordered budget trim) are deterministic and live in resolveMural /
 * renderMural.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors classify-memories: the host renders ONE prompt per chunk, a
 * zero-tool agent emits ONE XML manifest, and the host parses fail-closed and
 * applies COLUMN-ONLY writes (mural_cue). No per-memory tool calls.
 *
 * The cue grammar is adapted from the retired MURAL_AUTHORING_PROMPT: pidgin
 * anchors, symbol vocabulary, per-importance budget, prohibition polarity,
 * verbatim identifiers, XML-escaping. What is dropped: room names, merges,
 * selection, ranking, and the <mural>/<room> scaffolding — none of which the
 * model should decide anymore.

Each cue is a compact pidgin anchor that lets a reader recall the full memory at a glance — NOT a sentence, NOT a summary. You do not select, rank, group, merge, or reword the underlying facts; you compress each supplied memory into one cue, independently.

### Cue grammar
- A cue is mnemonic shorthand, not prose. Prefer one to three distinctive tokens plus a relation. Use the symbols → ← ⊘ ∵ ≺ ≻ ∅ ∀ when they are shorter than words.
- Preserve exact identifiers, paths, commands, flags, versions, filenames, hashes, and code tokens VERBATIM. These are the anchor — never abbreviate or paraphrase them.
- Per-cue hard budget (in characters): ${CUE_BUDGET_HIGH} when importance >= 70, else ${CUE_BUDGET_LOW}. Exceeding the budget makes the cue unusable, so compress harder rather than overrun.
- Never put a source memory id (e.g. #7863) in a cue.
- XML-escape &, <, >, and quotes in cue text (&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot;).
- A PROHIBITION must mark the excluded thing as ⊘thing followed IMMEDIATELY by a terse parenthesized mechanism, e.g. ⊘cache write (ABI break). Keep parentheses balanced. Positive facts must be phrased WITHOUT trigger words (must not / never / without / instead of / exclude).
- Do not invent facts, add commentary, or restate the category. Compress only what the memory says.

### Output contract
Output ONE XML manifest at the very end and NOTHING else — no narration, no per-memory commentary, no reasoning:
<cues>
<cue id="7863">terse anchor → relation</cue>
<cue id="8102">⊘cache write (ABI break)</cue>
</cues>

Rules:
- Emit exactly one <cue> per memory in the pool below, using its id.
- The complete <cues> root must be closed. Do not wrap it in a Markdown fence.`;
