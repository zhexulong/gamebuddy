const SCORING_GUIDANCE = `### How to score importance (1-100)
Importance decides which memories survive when the injected memory block is over budget: high scores stay in context, low scores drop first. So the score is only useful if it **discriminates** — if most memories land in the same band, you have not classified them, you have just labelled them.

Use judgment, not a formula. Blend:
- **Durability / decay-rate value:** Will this fact still matter weeks from now, across sessions?
- **Operational impact:** Would missing this fact cause wrong code, wasted time, broken workflows, or violated constraints?

Most memories are ordinary working facts — they belong in the middle, not the top. Reserve the high band for the genuinely load-bearing handful a teammate would be sunk without; push routine observations, one-off details, and now-obvious facts down. A "real, true fact" is not automatically important — truth is not importance.

Rough anchors (not quotas — spread naturally within them): transient/obvious observations 1-30, ordinary helpful project facts 40-65, load-bearing rules/architecture/constraints 70-100. A constraint that is a genuine must/never/always rule the project actively depends on floors around 60; but not every memory in a category is load-bearing — a niche, dated, or narrowly-scoped external quirk can sit lower even if it is a "constraint". Score the fact, not the label. If you assigned most of the pool to one band, re-read and differentiate.

One hard floor: an operating rule whose VIOLATION causes a public-facing or irreversible mistake — posting under the wrong identity, committing/pushing without approval, leaking private content, running destructive commands — scores at least 80. These rules only work if they are always in view; a mid-band score silently drops them from context exactly when the pool grows, and the violation happens. Judge by consequence-of-forgetting, not by how mundane the rule text reads.

### Scope
- \`project\` — only meaningful inside this repository/product (default when uncertain).
- \`ecosystem\` — useful to sibling projects in the same stack, harness, provider, or company ecosystem.
- \`universe\` — broadly true outside this codebase (protocol/platform/API facts), still written as a concise memory.

### Shareability
Shareability is about EXPOSURE, not scope: **would a teammate working on THIS SAME project benefit from seeing this memory, and is it free of anything personal, local, or sensitive?** If yes, set \`shareable="true"\`. This is the COMMON case — most project knowledge is exactly what you'd hand a new teammate: architecture, design rules, conventions, constraints, file locations, hard-won gotchas. Mark those shareable even though they are specific to this repo's internals.

Keep \`shareable="false"\` only for what is tied to the USER or their machine rather than the project: personal/absolute paths, usernames, local or private endpoints (e.g. localhost), credentials/secrets/tokens, customer data, machine-specific config, and personal working-style preferences. A fact's scope does NOT decide shareability. The host also fails closed and forces secret/credential/personal-path text to private regardless.`;

const OUTPUT_CONTRACT = `Output ONE XML manifest at the very end and NOTHING else — no narration, no per-memory commentary, no reasoning:
<classify>
<memory id="N" importance="75" scope="project" shareable="true"/>
<memory id="M" importance="20" scope="universe" shareable="false"/>
</classify>

Rules:
- Every memory in the pool below MUST appear exactly once.
- importance is an integer 1-100; scope is one of project|ecosystem|universe; shareable is true|false.`;
