/**
 * Sticky in-memory cache of the last "good" sidebar snapshot per session.
 *
 * Why this exists: the sidebar reads `last_input_tokens` from `session_meta` to
 * gate breakdown rendering on `inputTokens > 0`. There are intermittent windows
 * mid-turn where this value can briefly read 0 (mid-stream events that haven't
 * populated tokens yet, the first transform pass after restart resetting state
 * to clear stale percentages, etc.) — even though the session demonstrably has
 * existing context (compartments, facts, memories) and just rendered a healthy
 * breakdown a moment ago.
 *
 * The defensive UX rule: if the freshly built snapshot has `inputTokens === 0`
 * BUT we have a recent good snapshot for this session AND the session shows
 * explicit evidence of being "in flight" (historian/compartment work, pending
 * ops, or other active work signals), serve the cached values for the
 * breakdown instead of letting the bar flicker.
 *
 * What we never do:
 *   - Override anything when the live build genuinely succeeded
 *     (`inputTokens > 0`). Fresh data always wins.
 *   - Serve cached data forever — we cap age (default 5 min) so a session that
 *     legitimately rolls back to zero (revert, manual flush) eventually shows
 *     real state.
 *   - Cache before we have a real reading. The very first time we serve a
 *     session, if `inputTokens === 0`, we just pass through (true new session).
 *
 * Bounded by `BoundedSessionMap` to prevent leaks for sessions that are
 * never explicitly deleted (process crash, force-quit, archive).
