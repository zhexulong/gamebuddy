/**
 * Regression coverage for the history-budget resolver.
 *
 * The bug (AFT 2026-06-01, wire-confirmed): on the FIRST transform pass after a
 * restart, live usage is percentage=0 / inputTokens=0. The resolver used to
 * back-derive the context limit as inputTokens/(percentage/100) → 0/0 → bail
 * (undefined), and the caller fell through to the hard-coded 60K default. When
 * a re-materialize was forced on that same pass (m[1] cache cleared by the v26
 * migration), the decay renderer archived the oldest compartments to fit 60K
 * for a 1M-context model whose real history budget is ~98K, then stuck there
 * via cache_hit replay (337K→209K history chars).
 *
 * Fix: derive the budget from the model's STABLE resolved context limit
 * (resolveContextLimit), available even at percentage=0. The live-usage
 * back-derivation is kept only as a last-resort fallback.
