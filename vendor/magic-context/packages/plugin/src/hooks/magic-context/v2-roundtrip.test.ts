<compartment start="3" end="18" title="Wire SSE reconnect with jittered backoff" episode_type="feature" importance="72">
<p1>
Implemented SSE reconnect in src/stream/client.ts using jittered exponential backoff (base 500ms, cap 30s, full jitter). Reconnect attempts cap at 8 before surfacing a fatal error to the caller.

U: "make sure a flaky network doesn't hammer the server — add jitter"

Verified against a proxy that drops every 3rd connection; reconnect storms disappeared. Committed a1b2c3d.
