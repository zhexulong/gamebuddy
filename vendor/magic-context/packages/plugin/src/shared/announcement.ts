 * with no user-visible changes should leave both untouched — that way a user who
 * already dismissed the dialog for the current `ANNOUNCEMENT_VERSION` won't see
 * it again on the next bugfix bump.
 *
 * The persisted state is a single line of text (`last_announced_version`) under
 * `getMagicContextStorageDir()`. OpenCode and Pi share the same file because
 * they share the same storage root — so dismissing in one harness suppresses
 * the dialog in the other for the same announcement.
 *
 * Leave both empty (`""` and `[]`) to skip the dialog entirely.

 *
 * First-run / sandbox handling: when NO state file exists yet, we seed it to the
 * current `ANNOUNCEMENT_VERSION` and return false instead of announcing. This
 * covers two cases that previously spammed the dialog (issue #99):
 *   - Fresh installs: a brand-new user shouldn't be shown a changelog of release
 *     bullets they have no context for — they need onboarding, not patch notes.
 *   - Ephemeral/sandbox environments (Docker, CI, disposable dev containers)
 *     where the storage dir is wiped between launches: without the seed, the
 *     missing file made the announcement re-show on every single startup.
 * Real upgrades still announce exactly once: an existing user already has a
 * state file at the prior version, so the version mismatch shows the dialog and
 * dismissing it advances the file to the current version.
 *
 * The seed is a deliberate write side-effect on the "no file" branch — folding
 * it here (rather than a separate startup call) makes every caller path (plugin
 * startup, Pi startup, TUI rpc pull) consistent with no ordering dependency.
