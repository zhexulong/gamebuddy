//   - the OpenCode note-nudge `commit_detected` boundary (tag-messages.ts),
//   - the Pi note-nudge detector (detect-recent-commit.ts).
//
// These three previously each carried their own hash/verb regexes that had
// drifted (hash length 6 vs 7; verb sets {hash, sha} vs {merge, rebas}). Keeping
// them here stops that drift: change the patterns once and every site follows.
//
// All three sites look for a short git hash AND a commit-related word in the
// SAME assistant text part — the pairing is what keeps false positives low.

 * carried — a parity test asserts "hash <hex>" alone must NOT count as a commit,
