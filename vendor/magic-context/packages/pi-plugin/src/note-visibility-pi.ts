/**
 * Pi-side `hasVisibleNoteReadCall` — detects a non-stripped
 * `ctx_note(action="read")` tool call in a Pi `AgentMessage[]`. Used
 * by note-nudger to suppress note nudges while the agent currently
 * has visibility into the notes (and re-surface them once the read
 * has aged out). Mirrors OpenCode's `note-visibility.ts`.
 *
 * Pi shapes we care about:
 *   - Assistant message with content array containing
 *     `{ type: "toolCall", name: "ctx_note", arguments: { action: "read" } }`
 *
 * Pi's tool result message lives separately (`role: "toolResult"`), but
 * for visibility purposes the toolCall part on the assistant is what
 * tells us the read happened. The corresponding result is irrelevant
 * — even if the result was stripped, the call itself in context is
 * what gives the agent the memory of having read.
 *
 * Run AFTER all drops have been materialized so we don't false-
 * positive on a tool call that has been replaced by `[dropped §N§]`.
 * Pi tool calls that have been dropped via the sentinel path lose
 * their `arguments.action` field (replaced by an empty/sentinel
 * payload), so the action check naturally filters them out.
