/**

 *
 * Why detached: Pi's command handler IS the REPL turn (single process). Awaiting
 * a multi-pass recomp inline froze ALL input — new prompts and even /ctx-status —
 * until it finished (dogfood 2026-06-01: a 1105-message upgrade locked the REPL
 * across several ~4-min historian passes). OpenCode runs recomp/upgrade as
 * `void runManagedRecomp(...)` in its separate server process; Pi must do the
 * equivalent fire-and-forget so the REPL stays responsive while the historian
 * passes run in the background — the same pattern as `spawnPiHistorianRun`.
