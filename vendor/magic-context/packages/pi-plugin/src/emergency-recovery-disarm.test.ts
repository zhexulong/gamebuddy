/**
 * Regression guard for the emergency-recovery disarm predicate.
 *
 * BUG: a session whose overflow armed `needs_emergency_recovery=1`, then was
 * rescued by `/ctx-recomp` (covering all but a tiny in-progress tail), looped
 * forever — every transform pass force-bumped pressure to 95% because the flag
 * never cleared. Two clearing paths exist:
 *   1. historian publish → onPublished → clearEmergencyRecovery (never fires:
 *      the trigger needs a RUNNABLE window, which a tiny tail isn't), and
 *   2. the early `isEmergency` disarm, which used the LOOSE
 *      `hasEligiblePiCompartmentHistory(db, sessionId)` (no snapshot) — that
 *      returns true for "any raw message past the boundary", so it never
 *      disarmed.
 *
 * FIX: disarm inside `maybeFireHistorian`'s no-fire (`!trigger.shouldFire`)
 * branch, where the AUTHORITATIVE runnable-window snapshot is in hand — clear
 * the flag when recovery is armed AND there is no runnable compartment window.
 * This guard pins that predicate so a future refactor can't silently revert to
 * the loose check.
