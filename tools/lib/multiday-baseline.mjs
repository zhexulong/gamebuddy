/**
 * The single-player multi-day baseline: what a run must show before a co-op multi-day run can be
 * attributed at all.
 *
 * Crossing days inside one run exercises a batch of single-game engine changes - cross-day
 * re-anchoring, the day-end settlement menu, level-up menus, mail, stamina reset - and the co-op
 * topology adds a second machine's sleep handshake on top of them. When a co-op multi-day run stalls
 * there is no way to tell those apart unless the single-player half is already known to work, which
 * is the whole reason this baseline exists (design 1432: the ladder is a staged instrument, and an
 * outage must be attributable).
 *
 * The rules are read off RECEIPTS and OBSERVATIONS, never off the runner's prose:
 *   - every night's own `advance_day` terminal, and the Mod's own `saving_observed` /
 *     `saved_observed` / `day_started_observed` facts, cross-checked against the world the runner
 *     observed afterwards (a receipt claiming `day_advanced` while the calendar disagrees is a
 *     blocked result, never a pass);
 *   - the first night's `ShippingMenu` must be CLOSED by the product, with its own receipt: the
 *     menu is what holds the actor when a night ends, so a run that never closed it did not cross
 *     the day, whatever else it reports;
 *   - the day after a night must still produce the companion's own farm work, which is what makes
 *     this a loop rather than one rollover.
